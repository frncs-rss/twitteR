Twitter and R
==========

Word cloud
----------------
Using tweetCloud.R and the TweetCloud function, you can display a word cloud based on the most frequent terms appearing in n tweets matching a given search term.

For example, solar.png has been created from TweetCloud("#solar", 100).

Note that you may not get the same image since the function fetches the most recent tweets matching the search term.
